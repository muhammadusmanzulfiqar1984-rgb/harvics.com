# HARVICS AGENT GUARDRAILS

This repository uses HARVICS_SYSTEM_RULES.md as the permanent design law.
Never deviate without explicit user approval.

## Scope Interpretation (Mandatory)
- If user asks to change color/font/font-color/design system and does NOT provide explicit scope, treat as GLOBAL scope.
- GLOBAL scope = entire repository (all pages/components/routes, current and future).
- Only apply local scope when user explicitly narrows scope (e.g., T1 only, Header only, Hero only, specific file).
- T1/T2/T3 are header-local zones only. They are not global repo scope by themselves.

## Safety
- Visual patches must not silently alter auth/i18n/routing/logic unless explicitly requested.
- For broad global sweeps, state impact briefly and proceed unless user limits scope.
